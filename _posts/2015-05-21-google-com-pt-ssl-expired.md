A few days ago i've read somewhere that Google left expire a few domains. I've noticed that the one used at **google.com.pt** was about to expire but i didn't expect it to happen as Google fixed the others cases.

This is ridiculous, what would be the reason for letting another certificate expire after they were warned about that? 

A lot of people are unaware of the porpuse of SSL certificates and i know too many stranges cases of people acessing services like Portuguese Finances and others gov institutions and receiving certificate errors. One had happended **withing the Finances employes intranet**!  

It seems it's easy to bypass info here these days..
